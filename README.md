# üëã Hi, I'm Matan Elkobi!

## About Me
I am a **Linux Wizard** and **DevOps Evangelist** with over 15 years of experience in IT infrastructure, cloud technologies, and information security. 
I specialize in creating innovative solutions to enhance people, processes, and technology. Passionate about cutting-edge technologies, I bring expertise in DevOps, team leadership, and large-scale production environments.

When I'm not reading a good book or working out in the gym, you can find me at sea sailing on a yacht (skipper) ‚õµÔ∏è.  
I also studied impact entrepreneurship and established 2 projects in the fields of environmental sustainability. Veganism and fair trade.
